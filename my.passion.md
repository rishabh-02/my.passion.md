# Passion in life-
Hello Guys Today I would like to tell you something about passion.
My name is RIshabh and my childhood dream is to become a software engineer. I worked very hard to fulfill my dream. There was no light in my village. Nevertheless, I used to study in some way by asking for another laptop. I worked on a lot of live projects in my life. I enjoy working in the software field. He provides a professional type of feeling. I want to live my full life with the same professional feeling now. And I have to live with such feeling and this kick.
Thankyou KeenAble gave me the Opportunity..
